# Grid Sphere Animation

## 📌 Description
This Processing sketch creates a dynamic **3D grid of rotating spheres**, set against a deep blue background with an overlaid grid pattern. Each sphere is positioned with slight randomness to create an organic, ever-changing effect.

## 🚀 Features
- **Dynamic 3D Animation**: Rotating spheres create a hypnotic motion effect.
- **Structured Grid Overlay**: A visual grid adds contrast and structure.
- **Randomized Depth**: Spheres move slightly in the Z-axis for a layered effect.
- **P3D Mode**: Uses Processing's P3D renderer for smooth 3D rendering.

## 🎨 Visualization
The sketch generates a structured yet dynamic **3D visualization**, exploring depth, movement, and spatial variation. It blends elements of **abstract digital art** and **procedural randomness**.

## 🛠️ Usage
### 🔧 Requirements
- [Processing](https://processing.org/) 4.0 or later.

### ▶️ Run the Sketch
1. Copy the code into a new Processing `.pde` file.
2. Press the **Play** button or use `Ctrl + R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + R` (Mac).
3. Watch as the spheres rotate and shift dynamically.

### 🎛️ Customization
Modify these variables to tweak the effect:
- `gridSize`: Controls the number of spheres.
- `spacing`: Adjusts spacing between spheres.
- `deviation`: Controls randomness in position.
- `lineSpacing`: Alters the overlay grid density.
