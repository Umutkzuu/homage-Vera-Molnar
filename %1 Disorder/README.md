# Homage Vera Molnar 3

This project is an homage to Vera Molnár's "1% Disorder" algorithm. Originally written in Fortran, I have reimagined the concept using Python to visualize the concept of disorder with points. The algorithm introduces small random deviations to a regular grid, creating a visual pattern that represents a controlled disorder.

## 🖼️ Description
The project generates a grid of points that randomly deviate, creating a chaotic yet structured pattern. The final result mimics Molnár's exploration of the balance between order and disorder.

## 🧑‍💻 Installation
You can run this project on your local machine or within a Jupyter/Colab notebook. Simply ensure that the required libraries (`matplotlib` and `numpy`) are installed:
